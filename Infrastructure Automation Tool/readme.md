To provision infrastructure i will be proposing Terraform by Harshicorp which is an opensource. Reason behind using Terraform is
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as code, which means you can manage and version your infrastructure using the same tools and practices as software development. This helps ensure consistency, repeatability, and collaboration in infrastructure management.
* Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support: Terraform is cloud-agnostic, which means you can use it to provision and manage resources across various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and on-premises environments. This flexibility is valuable for organizations with multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategies.
* Declarative Syntax: Terraform uses a declarative configuration syntax, making it easy to understand and define the desired state of your infrastructure. You specify what you want, and Terraform handles the "how" of resource provisioning.
* Resource Abstraction: Terraform abstracts the complexities of interacting with cloud APIs and services, providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for managing resources. It has a vast ecosystem of providers for different cloud services, enabling resource provisioning without the need to write custom scripts.
* Plan and Apply Workflow: Terraform's "plan and apply" workflow allows you to preview changes before making them. This helps prevent unintended modifications to your infrastructure and provides a safety net for critical environments.
* State Management: Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the actual state of your infrastructure. This allows Terraform to make intelligent decisions about what changes need to be applied to reach the desired state.
* Community and Ecosystem: Terraform has a large and active community, which means there are numerous pre-built modules and configurations available for common infrastructure components. This accelerates development and reduces the need to reinvent the wheel.
* Integration: Terraform can be integrated with other DevOps tools and processes, such as version control systems (e.g., Git), continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and configuration management tools. This enables a seamless end-to-end automation process.
* Scalability: Terraform is suitable for managing infrastructure of all sizes, from small projects to large, complex environments. It scales well with your organization's infrastructure needs.
* Security and Compliance: Terraform supports infrastructure security and compliance requirements by allowing you to define and enforce policies through code. You can ensure that security best practices are followed consistently across your infrastructure.
* Extensibility: Terraform's open-source nature allows you to extend its functionality through custom providers and modules, making it adaptable to your unique infrastructure requirements.

With the terraform templates we can set-up GKE private cluster and the current state is stored in GCS bucket. 
Commands to run terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply, terraform destroy, terraform show, terraform validate.
